### FAQ

##### Why shall I download music if I can stream it online?
You know anon, streaming stuff online is cool but the amount of energy it consumes and the pressure it has on our planet is making it hotter. So you can help reduce the carbon footprint of music lovers just by downloading your regular dose of music.

#### Looking for something similar but more stable?
You can try out [spotify-dl](https://github.com/SathyaBhat/spotify-dl) and [spotDL](https://github.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader) too.
